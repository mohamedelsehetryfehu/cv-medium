# Introduction
Maintaining high-quality images is paramount for various applications, ranging from detailed analysis to accurate decision-making. However, images can sometimes contain unwanted patches that distort the overall quality and integrity. These patches may include defects or noise that can significantly impact image analysis or visual interpretation. In this project, we address the challenge of identifying and removing such patches from larger images, followed by interpolating missing pixels to seamlessly restore the image's integrity.

##  :beginner: About
This project focuses on developing an algorithm capable of automatically detecting and removing small, unwanted patches from larger images. The algorithm operates on the basis of two input images: a large base image containing the patch, and a smaller patch image. The patch may have been superimposed onto the base image at an arbitrary location and orientation. The algorithm is designed to rotate the patch image at multiples of 90 degrees (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and perform template matching to identify and remove the patch from the base image. Furthermore, it interpolates missing pixels to ensure a seamless transition in the resulting image.
